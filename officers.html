<h3>Brenda Betancourt. <font color=#1191d6>Treasurer</font></h3>
<span class="image left"><img src="images/brenda.jpg" alt="" /></span>

<p>My name is Brenda Betancourt and I am an <b><font color=#0f5e9b> Assistant Professor in the Department of Statistics at the University of Florida.</font></b> Previously, I was a Postdoctoral Associate in the Department of Statistical Science at Duke University working on <font color=#1191d6>Bayesian models and algorithms for entity resolution.</font>  I am originally from Bogotá, Colombia. I obtained my undergraduate degree at Universidad Nacional de Colombia where I was trained in classical Statistics. In 2008, I completed my M.S. in Statistics from the University of Puerto Rico, Río Piedras where I started to work on Bayesian Statistics. I moved to California in 2010 to pursue a Ph.D. in Statistics at the University of California, Santa Cruz where <font color=#1191d6>I worked on Bayesian models for network analysis.</font> You can find something more on <a href="https://people.clas.ufl.edu/bbetancourt/">webpage</a>.</p>

<!--### PROGRAM CHAIR ###################-->
<div class="6u$ 12u$(small)">
<h3>Akihiko Nishimura. <font color=#1191d6>Program Chair</font></h3>
<span class="image left"><img src="images/aki.jpg" alt="" /></span>

<p>
Aki is a <b><font color=#0f5e9b>post-doctoral researcher at UCLA</font></b> working with Prof. Marc Suchard on <font color=#1191d6>large-scale analytics of observational healthcare data</font>. He completed his PhD in Applied Mathematics and Statistics at Duke University under the supervision of Prof. David Dunson, during which he received Laplace Award and Savage Award (2nd place) for his research.
He develops statistical methods and softwares to extract useful insights from complex large-scale data sets, coming from various real-world applications. Current applications include subgroup identification (or ‘precision medicine’) in the first-line treatments of hypertensions, discovery of mutations linked to virulence among HIV viruses, etc. His expertise includes Bayesian methods, Monte Carlo simulation, high-performance computing, numerical mathematics, as well as open-source software development.
