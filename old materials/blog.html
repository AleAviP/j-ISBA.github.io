<h1>The <font color=#1191d6>j-ISBA</font> Blog</h1></header>
<p><b>j-ISBA is the junior Section of ISBA</b> (the International Society of Bayesian Statistics) aimed to promote events and forums 
for early career Bayesian researcher.</p> 

<p><font color=#1191d6>This blog wants to connect young Bayesians and propose events, conferences, training days, discussions and videos of 
interest, advertize positions all around the world, collect ideas… everything we need to create a network of young researchers</font>.
We know that entering a new career may be difficult, orient yourself in (or out of) the academic life may be confusing. 
Even looking at the literature for your work may be sometimes overwhelming. We want to propose this blog to make you more 
aware of all the possibilities you have, to provide introductions to some subjects of interest, to ask question or give your 
opinion.</p> 

<p>The <b><font color=#1191d6>j-ISBA blog</font></b> is also an experiment: we welcome any suggestion coming from the readers! <font color=#1191d6>If you want to propose a 
new post, please feel free to contact</font> <b><font color=#1191d6>Clara Grazian (jisba.section@gmail.com)</font></b>. We hope you will like our experiment and want to comment both the posts and the blog itself.
We hope you enjoy your visit! </p>

<h2>BIRS workshops in Oaxaca</h2>
<h3><font color=#1191d6>Clara Grazian</font> 26/09/2017</h3>
<p>The Banff International Research Station (BIRS) addresses the imperatives of collaborative and cross-disciplinary 
 research with a focus on the mathematical sciences and their vast array of applications in the sciences and in industry. 
 It is an inspiring and wonderful place where it is possible to organize 2 or 5-days workshops where it is the centre which
 pays for the participants' expenses. I had the chance to be at the Banff centre once and it's been a great experience, 
 both in terms of interest of the workshop and perfection of the place.</p> 
 
 <p>Recently, a new centre in Oaxaca, Mexico, has been affiliated to the BIRS, so now the workshops may take place in 
  either Banff or Oaxaca.</p> 
 
 <p>Nassif Ghoussoub, Scientific Director of the Banff International Research Station, has revently informed future 
  participants in one of the BIRS workshops in Oaxaca that all the current BIRS workshops hosted by Casa Matemática Oaxaca 
  (CMO) have not been affected by the tragic earthquakes in Mexico.</p> 
 
 <p>I think this is a good occasion for j-ISBA to send a thought to Mexico and to the Bayesian Mexican community, that is 
  so active. I would also like to call upon you to consider aiding the people of the State of Oaxaca, following the 
  example of Nassif Ghoussoub.</p>

<h2>Some news for nordic Bayesians</h2>
<h3><font color=#1191d6>Clara Grazian</font> 18/09/2017</h3>
<p>Do you come from the European nordic countries? (Whatever that means!). 
<br> Do you know that there is a group devoted to you? <b><font color=#1191d6>Bayes Nordics</font></b> is an email-list for the dissemination of news and events on Bayesian analysis in the Nordic countries. Everyone can join! Check it <a href="https://sites.google.com/site/bayesnordics/">here</a>
<br> The event are always of great interest, for example on November 1st there will be three 3-hour workshops 
 of relevance to the Bayesian paradigm at the 3rd Nordic Chapter Risk Conference.</p>
<div class="box">
<ul>
<li><font color=#1191d6>Building Bayesian networks.</font> Sakari Kuikka, Inari Helle (University of Helsinki).</li>
<li><font color=#1191d6>How to use expert knowledge elicitation in risk and uncertainty assessment?</font> Olaf Mosbach-Schultz, Nikolaos Georgiadis, Tony Smith (European Food Safety Authority).</li>
<li><font color=#1191d6>Probability bounds analysis: getting something from hardly anything.</font> Scott Ferson (University of Liverpool).</li>

<h2>Statistics and other strangers.</h2>
<h3><font color=#1191d6>Clara Grazian</font> 11/09/2017</h3>
<p>Welcome to all!<br>
I would like to thank the j-ISBA committee who makes this blog and the new website available. Let's get started with 
 this experiment! (I'll try to maintain a weekly frequency in the posts!)</p>
<p>I think the best way to start is a thought about what is statistics today; <font color=#1191d6>one of the key point is that it is a 
 data-driven science, in the sense that it studies ways to analyse the data but also the data available drive the 
 development of the discipline. And who better than Google can give an idea on how to work with data?</font><br>
I propose you a video showing <b>Tim Hesterberg, Senior Statistician at Google</b>, presenting examples on how they deal with the huge amount of data they have. Enjoy!</p>

<h2>Topic Contributed Session organized by <font color=#1191d6>j-ISBA at JSM2017</font>.</h2>
<h3><font color=#1191d6>Valerie  Poynor</font> 03/09/2017</h3>
<p><span class="image left"><img src="images/JSM2017.jpg" alt="" /></span>The j-ISBA committee members would like to give a BIG thanks and congratulations to <b>Frank Marrs</b>, <b>Willem Van Den Boom</b>, <b>Roberta De Vito</b>, <b>Raj Guahniyogi</b>, and <b>Jeffrey Miller</b> for delivering outstanding presentations during the j-ISBA session at this year's Joint Statistical Meeting in Baltimore!  Of course, another thanks goes out to the facilitator of the session, <b>James Johndrow</b>, who did a wonderful job at keeping speakers and audience discussions on point and true to the time allotted. The session took place July 31, 2017 at 8:30am and was titled: <b><a href="https://ww2.amstat.org/meetings/jsm/2017/onlineprogram/ActivityDetails.cfm?SessionID=214127">Junior Research in Bayesian Modeling for High-Dimensional Data</a></b>.  The session focused on new Bayesian techniques on dealing with high-dimesional data such as variable selection, shrinkage methods, and dimensionality reduction. Applications of these techniques included but were not limited to neuroscience, genetics, economics, biology, geological, and environmental data.  The session attracted about twenty audience members despite being an early morning session.  The questions from the audience were though provoking and lead to stimulating discussions. Needless to say the session was a success!! The <font color=#1191d6>j-ISBA committee is looking forward to many more j-ISBA sponsored sessions that feature the many talented young Bayesian researchers</font>.</p>
